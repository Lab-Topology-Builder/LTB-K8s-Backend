# Coding Conventions

## Naming

The following naming conventions are used in the project:

### [Naming conventions in Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go#names)

- *camelCase* for variables and functions, which are not exported
- *PascalCase* for types and functions that need to be exported

#### Examples

- **labInstanceStatus**: variable name for a status of a lab instance
- **UpdateLabInstanceStatus**: name for an exported function, starts with a capital letter

## Coding

- The Go extension in VSCode has a linting capability, so that will be used for linting and formatting.
