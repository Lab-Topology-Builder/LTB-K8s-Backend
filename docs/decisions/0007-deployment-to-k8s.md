# Deployment to K8s

## Context and Problem Statement

Files could be stored in git and deployed to a K8s cluster from there or we could use the frontend for that case.

## Considered Options

* Store files in Git
* Use frontend

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Store files in Git", because it makes automation of the deployment easier and reduces the possibility of human errors.
